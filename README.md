# StockXCrawler

Crawler for StocX transaction data. To use, first find the shoe name in StockX url, for example we would use "air-jordan-3-retro-unc-2020" as the shoe name from https://stockx.com/air-jordan-3-retro-unc-2020

<pre><code> python stockx_crawler.py air-jordan-3-retro-unc-2020
</code></pre>

This returns a csv file with transaction data.
